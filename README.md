# TODO Lists

These lists help both the developers keep track of what we've planned, and show the users what's coming.
Once everything here has been completed, this may be deleted.

## Unimplemented Features

This is a list of planned features that are currently unimplemented.

## Undocumented Features

- [ ] Syntax
  - [ ] Literals
    - [ ] Numeric
      - [ ] Integer
      - [ ] Floats

## Incorrect or Out of Date Documentation

These are places where the documentation is just wrong.

- [ ] Installation
  - [ ] Use LLVM 16 instead of LLVM 15
  - [ ] Use `cargo install --git`
- [ ] Functions -- don't mention `mut arg: &T`. Nothing good will come of this (you'll probably break something)
